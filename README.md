# Object-Detection-Tracking
Description:

This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model with OpenCV. It detects multiple objects simultaneously in webcam feed or videos, draws bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores, and tracks their movement across frames. This is ideal for surveillance, automation, and computer vision-based analytics.
